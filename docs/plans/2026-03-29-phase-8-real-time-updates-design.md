# Phase 8: Real-Time Updates — Design Spec

**Date**: 2026-03-29
**Status**: Approved

## Overview

Add WebSocket support to MemoryVault so the Angular UI receives live signals when server-side state changes — new feed items, sync job progress, video download completions, bookmark ingests, and cross-tab mutations. The client reacts by refetching data through existing GraphQL/REST queries. No polling.

## Decisions

| Decision          | Choice                            | Rationale                                                                                      |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Signal model      | Lightweight signals (no payloads) | Client refetches via existing queries; server stays simple                                     |
| Transport         | WebSocket + STOMP (simple broker) | Decouples from app server; swappable to external broker (Amazon MQ, Redis) on AWS              |
| Auth              | JWT validated on STOMP CONNECT    | Reuses existing JwtService; prevents unauthenticated connections                               |
| Internal eventing | Spring ApplicationEvents          | Services stay decoupled from WebSocket; same event shape works when services move to Lambda    |
| Threading         | `@Async` relay with dedicated executor | Isolates relay failures from sync services; mirrors AWS architecture (decoupled consumption) |
| Error handling    | Best-effort signals, catch-and-swallow | Missed signal = stale until next signal or manual refresh; never break a sync job            |

## Event Types

All five event categories are in scope:

1. **Feed sync completion** — feed refreshed, N new items
2. **Sync job progress** — job status transitions (PENDING → RUNNING → SUCCESS/FAILED)
3. **Video download status** — per-video download completion
4. **Bookmark ingest ready** — CLI-submitted ingest available for review
5. **Cross-tab content sync** — mutations in one tab reflected in others

---

## Backend Architecture

### Dependencies

Add `spring-boot-starter-websocket` to `build.gradle.kts`.

### WebSocket Configuration

`config/WebSocketConfig.kt`:
- `@EnableWebSocketMessageBroker`
- Simple in-memory STOMP broker on prefix `/topic`
- Application destination prefix `/app` (reserved for future client→server messages)
- WebSocket endpoint at `/ws` with SockJS fallback
- Allowed origins: `http://localhost:4200` (matches existing CORS config)

### JWT Authentication on Connect

`config/WebSocketAuthInterceptor.kt`:
- `ChannelInterceptor` on the inbound CONNECT frame
- Extracts JWT from STOMP `Authorization` header (query param as fallback)
- Validates with existing `JwtService`
- Sets `Principal` on the STOMP session
- Rejects invalid/missing tokens by closing the connection

### Security Config Update

Permit `/ws/**` in the HTTP security chain (WebSocket upgrade starts as HTTP). STOMP-level interceptor handles auth after upgrade.

---

## Domain Events

### Event Type Enum

```kotlin
enum class VaultEventType {
    FEED_SYNC_COMPLETED,
    JOB_STATUS_CHANGED,
    VIDEO_DOWNLOAD_COMPLETED,
    INGEST_READY,
    CONTENT_MUTATED
}
```

### Event Hierarchy

```
VaultEvent (sealed interface)
├── eventType: VaultEventType
├── userId: UUID
├── timestamp: Instant
│
├── FeedSyncCompleted(userId, feedId?, newItemCount, feedsRefreshed)
├── JobStatusChanged(userId, jobId, jobType, oldStatus, newStatus)
├── VideoDownloadCompleted(userId, videoId, listId, success)
├── IngestReady(userId, previewId, itemCount)
└── ContentMutated(userId, contentType, mutationType, entityId?)
```

`ContentMutated` uses two enums:
- `contentType`: BOOKMARK, FEED_ITEM, VIDEO, FOLDER, CATEGORY
- `mutationType`: CREATED, UPDATED, DELETED

### Publishing Points

| Service | Event Published | Trigger |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| `FeedSyncService` / `RssFetchService` | `FeedSyncCompleted` | After sync completes |
| `SyncJobService` | `JobStatusChanged` | On `recordStart`, `recordSuccess`, `recordFailure` |
| `VideoSyncService` | `VideoDownloadCompleted` | After each video download attempt |
| `IngestService` | `IngestReady` | After ingest preview is stored |
| `BookmarkService`, `FeedItemService`, `VideoService`, `FolderService`, `CategoryService` | `ContentMutated` | On create, update, delete mutations |

Services inject `ApplicationEventPublisher` and call `publishEvent()` at the end of their operations.

---

## WebSocket Relay

### WebSocketEventRelay

`websocket/WebSocketEventRelay.kt`:
- Single `@Component` with `@EventListener` methods for each `VaultEvent` subtype
- Injects `SimpMessagingTemplate`
- Converts each event to a lightweight JSON signal and sends to the appropriate STOMP topic

### STOMP Topic Structure

All topics are user-scoped: `/topic/user/{userId}/...`

| Topic                          | Event                    | Signal Payloa d                                       |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `/topic/user/{userId}/feeds`   | `FeedSyncCompleted`      | `{ eventType, feedId?, newItemCount }`                |
| `/topic/user/{userId}/jobs`    | `JobStatusChanged`       | `{ eventType, jobId, jobType, newStatus }`            |
| `/topic/user/{userId}/videos`  | `VideoDownloadCompleted` | `{ eventType, videoId, listId, success }`             |
| `/topic/user/{userId}/ingests` | `IngestReady`            | `{ eventType, previewId, itemCount }`                 |
| `/topic/user/{userId}/sync`    | `ContentMutated`         | `{ eventType, contentType, mutationType, entityId? }` |

User-scoped topics ensure clients only receive their own events. The relay reads `userId` from the domain event and targets that user's topic. Explicit topic paths (not `convertAndSendToUser()`) for consistency with future external broker routing.

---

## Angular Client

### Dependencies

Add `@stomp/rx-stomp` — RxJS-native STOMP client with built-in auto-reconnect.

### WebSocketService

`core/services/websocket.service.ts`:
- Connects on login, disconnects on logout
- STOMP connection to `ws://localhost:8080/ws` with JWT in STOMP headers
- Exposes `on(topic: string): Observable<StompMessage>` for topic subscriptions
- Auto-reconnect with exponential backoff (rx-stomp built-in)
- Reads `userId` from decoded JWT to construct user-scoped topic paths

### Store Integration

Each NgRx Signal Store subscribes to its relevant topic(s) and triggers a refetch:

| Store            | Subscribes To                          | Action on Signal                                           |
|------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ReaderStore`    | `/feeds`, `/sync` (FEED_ITEM)          | `loadCategories()`, `loadItems()`                          |
| `BookmarksStore` | `/sync` (BOOKMARK, FOLDER), `/ingests` | `loadBookmarks()`, `loadFolders()`, `loadPendingIngests()` |
| `YoutubeStore`   | `/videos`                              | `loadLists()`, reload selected list videos                 |
| `AdminStore`     | `/jobs`                                | `loadJobs()`                                               |

### Debounce

Rapid-fire signals (e.g., 50 `ContentMutated` events from a bulk sync) are debounced with a 500ms window per store, so only one refetch fires.

### Cross-Tab

Each tab maintains its own WebSocket connection. When tab A performs a mutation, the service publishes `ContentMutated`, and tab B's connection receives it independently and refetches.

---

## Testing Strategy

### Backend Unit Tests (MockK)

- **Event publishing**: Verify each service calls `applicationEventPublisher.publishEvent()` with the correct event type and data
- **WebSocketEventRelay**: Mock `SimpMessagingTemplate`, verify `convertAndSend` is called with correct topic path and payload for each event type
- **WebSocketAuthInterceptor**: Verify accepts valid JWT, rejects invalid/missing tokens

### Backend Integration Tests (TestContainers + STOMP test client)

One integration test per event type:
- Connect a STOMP test client to `/ws` with valid JWT
- Subscribe to the relevant user topic
- Trigger the service action (feed sync, job status change, video download, ingest, content mutation)
- Assert the correct signal arrives on the subscription within a timeout

### Frontend Unit Tests (Vitest)

- **WebSocketService**: Mock STOMP client, verify connect/disconnect lifecycle and topic subscription wiring
- **Store integration**: Mock `WebSocketService.on()` to emit a signal, verify the store calls the appropriate load method
- **Debounce**: Emit multiple rapid signals, verify only one refetch fires

### E2E Test (Playwright)

Single smoke test proving the full chain:
- Open two browser tabs
- Mark a feed item read in tab A
- Assert tab B reflects the change without manual refresh

---

## Logging

Per project conventions, all new classes get `private val log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(javaClass)`.

| Component | Level | What |
|-----------|-------|------|
| `WebSocketAuthInterceptor` | INFO | Successful WebSocket connect (userId) |
| `WebSocketAuthInterceptor` | WARN | Auth failure — invalid/missing JWT (remote address) |
| `WebSocketAuthInterceptor` | INFO | WebSocket disconnect (userId, session duration) |
| `WebSocketEventRelay` | DEBUG | Event received and signal sent (eventType, userId, topic) |
| `WebSocketEventRelay` | WARN | Failed to relay signal (eventType, userId, error message) |
| Domain services | DEBUG | Event published (eventType, userId, relevant IDs) |

DEBUG for relay signals keeps logs quiet under normal operation; bump to INFO via Logback config when debugging WebSocket issues.

---

## Threading

`@Async` on the relay's `@EventListener` methods, with a dedicated thread pool executor:

- `WebSocketConfig` (or a separate `AsyncConfig`) defines a `ThreadPoolTaskExecutor` named `websocketRelayExecutor` — small pool (2–4 threads), since `convertAndSend()` is non-blocking
- `@Async("websocketRelayExecutor")` on each `@EventListener` method in `WebSocketEventRelay`
- `@EnableAsync` on the config class

**Why `@Async`:**
- Isolates relay exceptions from the publishing service — a relay failure never breaks a sync job
- Mirrors the eventual AWS architecture where event consumption is always on a separate thread (external broker consumer)
- Switching to `@Async` later would require verifying no ordering assumptions crept in; doing it from the start avoids that

**Ordering**: Signals are lightweight refetch triggers, not ordered data streams. If two signals arrive out of order, the client refetches the same data either way. No ordering guarantees needed.

---

## Error Handling

### Backend — WebSocket Auth Interceptor
- Invalid/missing JWT: log WARN, reject the STOMP CONNECT frame (send ERROR frame, close session). Do not throw — Spring's channel interceptor contract expects a clean return or `null` message.

### Backend — WebSocket Event Relay
- `convertAndSend()` failure: catch, log WARN with event details, swallow. A failed signal means the client misses one update and stays on stale data until the next signal or manual refresh. This is acceptable — signals are best-effort, not guaranteed delivery.
- Exception in event deserialization/mapping: same — catch, log ERROR, swallow. Never propagate back to the async executor (would only log to stderr and be lost).

### Backend — Domain Event Publishing
- `publishEvent()` is fire-and-forget from the service's perspective (async relay). If `ApplicationEventPublisher` itself throws (should not happen), it would propagate — but this is a Spring framework failure, not something we handle.

### Frontend — WebSocket Connection
- Connection failure / server unreachable: rx-stomp auto-reconnects with exponential backoff. No user-facing error — the UI works normally via manual fetches, just without live updates.
- Auth rejection (ERROR frame): log to console. If the JWT expired, the next HTTP request will also 401 and trigger the existing redirect-to-login flow.
- Stale connection (server restart): rx-stomp detects disconnect and reconnects. Stores re-subscribe automatically on reconnect.

### Frontend — Signal Processing
- Malformed signal payload: catch in the `WebSocketService.on()` observable, log to console, skip. Don't break the subscription.
- Refetch failure after signal: handled by existing store error handling (stores already handle failed GraphQL queries).

## Connection Lifecycle

### STOMP Heartbeats

Configure server and client heartbeats to detect dead connections:
- Server sends heartbeat every 10s, expects client heartbeat every 10s
- Configured in `WebSocketConfig` via `configureMessageBroker`: `setHeartbeatValue(longArrayOf(10000, 10000))`
- rx-stomp client configured to match: `heartbeatIncoming: 10000, heartbeatOutgoing: 10000`
- If no heartbeat received within the timeout window, Spring closes the session and cleans up resources

### JWT Expiry Mid-Session

WebSocket connections are long-lived and may outlive the JWT used at CONNECT time. Policy: **validate once at connect, do not re-validate mid-session.** Rationale:
- Signals are lightweight and contain no sensitive data (just event types and IDs)
- The JWT expiry (24h per current config) is long enough that sessions rarely outlive it
- If the JWT expires, the next HTTP request (GraphQL refetch triggered by a signal) will 401 and redirect to login, which also tears down the WebSocket connection via the logout flow
- Re-validating mid-session would require either periodic checks on a timer (complexity for no real security gain) or validating on every message (performance overhead on a high-frequency channel)

### Graceful Shutdown

On server shutdown (restart, deploy):
- Spring's `@PreDestroy` on the WebSocket config closes all active STOMP sessions
- Clients receive a disconnect event; rx-stomp begins auto-reconnect with backoff
- No custom shutdown message needed — the client's reconnect behavior handles this transparently
- After reconnect, stores re-subscribe and refetch current state (same as initial page load)

---

## Resource Limits

### Connection Limits

For a self-hosted, single-user application, aggressive connection limits are unnecessary. Sensible defaults:
- **No per-user connection cap** — a handful of tabs is the expected usage pattern
- **Spring's default send buffer limit** (512KB) and send timeout (10s) are sufficient
- If buffer fills (slow client), Spring closes the session — client reconnects automatically

These defaults are revisited if the application moves to multi-tenant (Phase 9+).

### Message Rate

Signals are produced by sync operations, not user input — the rate is naturally bounded:
- Feed sync: one `FeedSyncCompleted` + N `ContentMutated` per sync (N = new items, typically < 100)
- Video sync: one `VideoDownloadCompleted` per video download (slow, minutes apart)
- Content mutations: one per user action (bookmark, mark-read, etc.)

No rate limiting needed on the server side. Client-side debounce (500ms) in the stores handles burst scenarios.

## AWS Migration Path

The architecture is designed for a clean AWS transition:

**Today**: `Service → ApplicationEvent → WebSocketEventRelay → Simple STOMP Broker → Client`

**On AWS**: `Lambda → SNS/SQS/Redis → External Broker (Amazon MQ) → Client`

- Services already speak domain events, not STOMP messages
- Swapping the simple broker for Amazon MQ requires only config changes in `WebSocketConfig`
- Lambdas publish the same event shape to SNS/Redis; a bridge listener forwards to the broker
- ALB and API Gateway both support WebSocket connections natively
